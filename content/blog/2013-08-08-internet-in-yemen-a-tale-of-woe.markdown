Haykal Bafana paints a [sad picture](http://blog.haykal.sg/index.php/yemen1/20-ec/20-internet-in-yemen-a-tale-of-woe) of the state of internet access in Yemen.

> Each time a saboteur cuts the fiber optic lines in Marib, Internet access in Sanaa and even eastern Yemeni regions such as Hadhramaut are affected severely. Many have asked me before : why should a sparsely populated desert area like Marib be so critical to Yemen's Internet service? A detour into the murky history of Yemeni telecommunications is necessary.

Despite some of the world's most important undersea cable networks [^1] passing through Yemen's maritime borders and one of them having two landing points [^2] inside Yemen, the country's sole internet provider buys internet from Saudi Arabia's STC.

It is a fascinating story about the confluence of politics, corruption and technology.

[^1]: [I-ME-WE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-ME-WE), [Europe India Gateway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_India_Gateway), [EASSy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EASSy) and [Falcon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-Optic_Link_Around_the_Globe#Segment_FLAG_Alcatel-Lucent_Optical_Network_.28FALCON.29) pass through Yemeni maritime borders. [Greg's Cablemap](http://www.cablemap.info/) provides an interactive map of the under sea cable system.
